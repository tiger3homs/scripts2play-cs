**Transform your play-cs.com/myservers page into a powerful, organized server management hub.**

![alt text](image-1.png)


This Tampermonkey script provides a complete overhaul of the server management interface on [play-cs.com/myservers](https://play-cs.com/myservers). It replaces the standard table layout with a modern, collapsible card system, adding numerous quality-of-life features designed to make managing your Counter-Strike servers more efficient and enjoyable.

## ✨ Features

*   **Collapsible Server Cards:** Each of your servers is displayed as an individual card. Click the header to expand or collapse it, revealing or hiding detailed settings.
*   **Per-Server Controls:**
    *   Edit server name, enable/disable, and public/private status directly.
    *   Adjust individual CVar settings.
    *   View real-time status updates in the card header (e.g., Enabled/Disabled, Visible/Hidden, current map).
*   **Configuration Presets:**
    *   Quickly apply predefined settings for common game modes like "Public," "5vs5," and "Deathmatch" with a single click.
    *   Automatically sets relevant checkboxes and CVars according to the chosen preset.
*   **Discord Integration:**
    *   Share your server's name, map, PIN, and join link directly to a Discord channel via webhook.
    *   Configure your webhook URL easily through a dedicated modal (Alt+Shift+D to open).
*   **Searchable Map Dropdowns:** No more endless scrolling! Find your desired map instantly with a search input integrated into the map selection dropdown.
*   **Improved UI/UX:**
    *   Sleek, dark-themed design for better readability and a consistent look.
    *   Collapsible "New Server" and "Specifications" sections to keep the page tidy.
    *   Global Save button is relocated and made more prominent.
*   **Server Owner Lookup:** Automatically fetches and displays the username of the server owner when only an ID is provided in the admin notice.
*   **Fixed Server Links:** Corrects malformed server join links to ensure they always work.
*   **Toast Notifications:** Provides subtle, non-intrusive pop-up messages for actions like saving webhooks or sharing servers.
*   **Dynamic Header Updates:** Server card headers update instantly when you change the server name, enabled/public status, or map.

    *   Quickly apply your custom presets from the "MODE" selector.
    *   Delete custom presets you no longer need with a single click.
